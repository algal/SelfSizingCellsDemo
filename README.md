The WWDC2014 session "What's new in TableViews and Collection Views" talks about self-sizing cells.

The speaker, Olivier, shows an example of collection view cells that self-size based on internal Auto Layout constraints.

This project reproduces that example.

Notably, this functional does not seem to be working in Interface Builder as of Xcode6Beta5.

But it works in code.
